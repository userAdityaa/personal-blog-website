# Personal_Blog_Website

This is not a clone of a big website but a website I came across while checking some design in webflow. I liked the glowing effect and minimalism in it. 
- The front end required some heavy work like different animation, transition, glowing border and text, include GIF.
- The Back end including purchasing of item and putting it in the cart whereas sign up form (Auth/Validation) and all those backend requirement.
